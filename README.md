# All my remaining **\*.vmf** files from 2019 to 2025.
After multiple OS reinstallations, I lost the most part of my maps archive, I decided to upload my last *.vmf files
for free use.
## Required games and mods (content):
1. Garry's Mod
2. Counter Strike: Global Offensive
3. Day of Infamy
4. Left 4 Dead 1 and 2
5. Half-Life 2 and Episodes
6. Counter Strike: Source
7. Day of Defeat: Source
8. Portal 1 and 2
9. Swelter
10. Snowdrop Escape
11. Insurgency
12. Black Mesa
13. Entropy: Zero 2
14. INFRA
15. No More Room in Hell

There may be a few unneccesary  games, but I don't really know which ones exactly, so it will be better if you buy and download all listed games.

You can use every *.vmf file with any goal, you don't need to ask my permission to use them. Tho, it would be nice, if you would send a link to your creation that uses my *.vmf files.
