There may be a few unneccesary  games, but I don't really know which ones exactly, so it will be better if you buy and download every listed game.

You can use any *.vmf file(s) with any goal, you don't need to ask for my permission to use any. Though, it would be nice, if you send me a link to your creation that uses my *.vmf file(s).
